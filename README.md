# 02_Data_Analysis_&_Visualization_with_Pandas

This project centers around the analysis of business data using Python, with a specific focus on data visualization utilizing the Seaborn library.

We work as a team of three, tasked with investigating the purchase information of the e-commerce tech company 'Eniac' and determining whether it would be beneficial to offer product discounts.

The primary challenge of this project is situated in transforming a messy dataset into a clean and reliable source, suitable for extracting meaningful insights. The raw data is currently corrupted, requiring careful data cleansing and preparation.
