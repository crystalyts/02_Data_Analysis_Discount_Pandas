# 02_Data_Analysis_Discount_Pandas

This project centers around the analysis of business data using Python, with focus on data visualization utilizing the Seaborn library.

We work as a team of three, tasked with investigating the purchase information of the e-commerce tech company 'Eniac' and determining whether revenue grows whenever discounts increase.

The primary challenge of this project is situated in transforming a messy dataset into a clean and reliable source, suitable for extracting meaningful insights. The raw data is currently corrupted, requiring careful data cleansing and preparation.

## Code
- `preprocessing/step_1_cleansing` involves filtering and removing corrupted data, duplicate rows, dealing with missing values, changing datatypes.
- `preprocessing/step_2_quality` involves excluding unwanted orders, aligning differences between dataframes and re-arranging columns.
- `discount_analysis` involves merging dataframes, visualizing the data for insight extraction, assigning products categories, analysing the relationship between discount and reveune.

## Results
- `02_presentation_discount` Based on our analysis, implementing discounts does not appear to significantly increase the revenue. However, we have identified seasonality as a prominent factor influencing sales.
